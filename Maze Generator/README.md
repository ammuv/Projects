# Maze Generator
Imaze: A Maze generation module that creates a maze based on user requirements, namely the no of cells in the maze
and the complexity of the maze. It uses disjoint set data structure and Kruskals algorithm to achieve efficiency in
Ackermann time. It was implemented using graphical interface in Java.
